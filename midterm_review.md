For my review , in the first five COMP 170 assignments, I ran into a few simple hiccups that turned into valuable lessons. My very first program wouldn’t start because I’d missed a basic setup step—ever since, I’ve made it a rule to run and test every script before saving or moving on. In early loop exercises, I accidentally created endless loops by placing my update step in the wrong spot, which taught me to sketch out the logic on paper before I begin typing. When I worked with file input and output, I once lost data because I didn’t close a file properly; switching to a method that automatically handles file closing saved me from that problem forever. I also noticed my code was hard to follow without any comments, so I’ve committed to weaving in clear, concise notes that explain why each section exists.Meeting one on one with Mr Leo was a turning point. He helped me establish a steady study rhythm, encouraged me to keep up with the weekly readings, and showed me how to break larger assignments into manageable steps. After that chat, I blocked out regular reading sessions and now come to class feeling more prepared and confident.Over these six weeks, I’ve treated COMP 170 like a part-time job I genuinely care about. I log into our virtual classroom on time every session—only missing one class for a university-approved reason—and I dedicate nine to twelve extra hours each week to coding practice and review. Whenever I hit a snag, I email Mr Leo with a clear description and sample code so we can resolve issues quickly. By staying organized, reaching out proactively, and making a habit of adding meaningful comments, I’m set up to avoid past mistakes and keep growing in the second half of the course.
